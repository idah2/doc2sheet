# doc2sheet

This Python script uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML of a Google Doc that contains highlights and comments and outputs a csv.

To use the script, follow the following steps: 

1. Download Google Doc as html

2. Clean html file with a tool like www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html

3. Place the file in the same directory as Python script

4. Run the Python script

Customization will likely be needed to ensure that the correct classes are selected for the input document.
